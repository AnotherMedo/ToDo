# ToDo

This project is my first try at web development (and the first few lines of `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` I have ever written :) ). It is **heavily** inspired by a tutorial from the Youtube channel **[How to Become a Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OqWCGVaOkA)** with a few changes and small enhancements (color scheme, counter logic...) to make it my own.
